# SmartAttendance Project

This project aims to create a Unified Smart Attendance and School Bus Monitoring System.

## Getting Started

1.  **Transfer Files to Raspberry Pi:**
    *   Copy the entire `SmartAttendance` folder from your Windows machine to a USB drive.
    *   Plug the USB drive into your Raspberry Pi.
    *   Copy the `SmartAttendance` folder from the USB drive to a desired location on your Raspberry Pi (e.g., `/home/pi/SmartAttendance`).

2.  **Install Tkinter (if not already installed):**
    *   Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
    *   Run the command: `sudo apt-get update`
    *   Then run: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

3.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
    *   Navigate to the project directory: `cd /home/pi/SmartAttendance` (or wherever you copied it).
    *   Run the main script: `python3 main.py`

You should see a window appear on your Raspberry Pi's display with the message "Hello, SmartAttendance!".
